In this project, I developed a website with a custom pet design, using modern technologies such as Astro and Tailwind CSS. The site is hosted on Vercel, which ensures fast deployment and optimized performance.

The design of the site is based on an interactive timeline that shows the evolution and stages of the mascot. I used Tailwind CSS to create an attractive and responsive layout, ensuring the timeline looks and works well on any device, from mobile to large desktop screens.

I have developed an exciting project dedicated to giveaways, using React along with Tailwind CSS and hooks to optimize the experience. This project allowed me to explore advanced web development techniques, ensuring a modern and responsive interface that adapts perfectly to any device. 

The integration of Tailwind CSS made it easy to create an attractive and coherent design, while the use of hooks in React improved state management and site interactivity. This project not only allowed me to expand my technical skills, but also ensured a smooth and efficient user experience on the giveaway page.

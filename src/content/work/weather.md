In this project, I developed a weather website using React, CSS, and an API to get the weather data. The site is hosted on Vercel, which ensures fast deployment and optimized performance.

In addition to implementing basic functionality, I integrated an API to obtain real-time weather data, which significantly improves the accuracy and usability of the site. I also worked on improving error handling, ensuring that the user receives clear and useful messages in case of problems with data collection or connectivity.

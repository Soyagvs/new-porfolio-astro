In this project, I focused on making a site with 3D animations using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The site is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast deployment and optimized performance.

This project allowed me to gain experience in responsive design and web layout. I made sure the site would adapt perfectly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop screens, using Tailwind's CSS utilities to achieve a consistent and attractive design on any device.

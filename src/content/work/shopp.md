In this project I developed a store website with shopping logic, using React and CSS. The site is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast deployment and optimized performance.

In addition to implementing purchasing logic, I integrated an API to handle product data and error management, creating a store website that is efficient, functional, and provides a smooth and reliable user experience.

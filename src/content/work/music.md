In this project, I developed a music player using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, consuming an external API for obtaining data. The application is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast deployment and optimized performance.

The player's design includes an interactive section that displays playlists and allows streaming music playback. I used CSS to create an attractive and responsive design, ensuring the content looks and works well on any device, from mobile to large desktop screens.
